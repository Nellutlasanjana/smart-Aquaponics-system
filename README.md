# smart-Aquaponics-system
The IoT-driven Smart Aquaponics System integrates sensors and machine learning (ML) to enhance efficiency and sustainability in aquaponics farming. The system utilizes an LM35 sensor to monitor water temperature, a pH sensor to ensure optimal acidity levels, and a servo motor to automate fish feeding based on real-time data. These sensors continuously track environmental conditions, sending data to a centralized platform for remote monitoring and control. Machine learning algorithms analyze this data to predict water quality fluctuations, optimize feeding schedules, and detect anomalies in plant and fish growth. By automating adjustments, the system minimizes manual intervention, improves yield, and ensures stable conditions for both fish and plants. The user-friendly interface provides insights for farmers, enabling proactive decision-making. This project combines IoT-driven automation with AI-driven analytics, offering a smart, resource-efficient, and scalable solution for sustainable aquaponics, benefiting both small-scale and commercial farmers.
